function Get-TempdbUsage {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets Tempdb usage for running queries.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function queries DMVs for running sessions using Tempdb and returns results if those sessions have user or internal space allocated or deallocated against them.

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
    The SQL Instance you are querying against.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
    If you want to use alternative credentials to connect to the server.

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
    Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed.

    .PARAMETER Confirm
    Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
    By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
    This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
    Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
