# sqlshell

sqlshell is a GPL v2 fork of dbatools focusing on speed and simplicity.

## Why fork instead of contribute

We really love dbatools, but there's a few things that make this project different enough.

* We want a smaller codebase to base our individual projects off of.
* We want a "pure" PowerShell solution, so it is easy for us to fix and debug some of the more esoteric problems.
* We want to experiment with new technologies (Azure, PowerShell Core) and ignore those that are maintenance burden (SQL 2012+!!)
* We really like the GPLv2, and we are sorry if your lawyers dont.
